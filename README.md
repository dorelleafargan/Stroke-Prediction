# Stroke-Prediction
Stroke Prediction 94.5% Accuracy.

Introduction to Data Science Project Course Final Project - HIT.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Stroke is a medical emergency. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status and more.
